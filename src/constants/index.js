    description:
      `Developed a job-matching system using the Doc2Vec algorithm, enabling semantic matching between resumes and job descriptions.
       The project leveraged advanced text processing with NLTK and SpaCy for tokenization and lemmatization, and utilized Gensim for Doc2Vec implementation. 
       Integrated a deep learning model to enhance accuracy, employing Pandas and NumPy for efficient data handling. The system provides an accuracy score for 
       how well a resume fits a job description and generates the top 5 most suitable resumes for any given job description. It calculates cosine similarity scores to quantify matches, processing datasets from Kaggle and Hugging Face, specifically tailored to the tech industry. This approach resulted in a powerful tool that significantly streamlines the recruitment process.`,
